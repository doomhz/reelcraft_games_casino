  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.

  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|

    # Display the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine
    vb.gui = false

    # Set memory and number of CPUS
    vb.memory = "2048"

    # Allow symbolic links in shared folders from Windows hosts
    # You may also want to run `npm install -–no-bin-links` instead of `npm install`
